# Advent of Code 2024 - Go Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in Go.

## Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day's solution in its own directory:
advent-of-code-2024/
├── day_1/
├── day_2/
├── day_3/
├── day_4/
├── day_5/
├── day_6/
├── day_7/
└── aoc/ # Shared utilities

Each day's directory contains at least:
- `main.go` - The main solution file
- `input.txt` - The puzzle input

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

1. Navigate to the day's directory:
   ```bash
   cd day_N
   ```

2. Run the solution:
    ```bash
    go run .
    ```
Each solution prints both Part One and Part Two answers.

## Common Utilities
The aoc package contains shared utilities used across different solutions, such as file reading and input parsing functions.
